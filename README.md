# marine-seismo-intro

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (explore_data.ipynb) that functions as an example of how I process/look at marine earthquake data.

Also included is a yml file for creating the necessary conda environment to run the code and an earthquake catalog data file, in quakeml format.
